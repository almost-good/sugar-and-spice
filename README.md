# Sugar and Spice
**Sugar and Spice** is a company that makes custom made-candles, includes its customers in the entire development process and offers a deeply personalized experience. The website is targeted toward people that are interested in the purchase of custom-shaped candles containing specific or random scent mixtures.

Sugar and Spice, or *SaS*, features a "recipe" on how to order a candle, as it is not a modern webshop but takes more traditional approach where, depending on the needs, the customer is presented with the **price quote**.
Users can also view all essential oils available for candle mixtures, a bit of information about them, and the most popular scents which are updated monthly.
Lastly, the site includes a gallery of previous works done, which can be used as inspiration for coming up with new interesting candle shapes.

## **Developer's Note**
Sugar and Spice project is created as a **Portfolio Project** for Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer program. 
The project showcases my skills in HTML and CSS, which I acquired as a Code Institute student.

Please **note:** This website is purely fictional, and the company in question does not exist. Although I enjoy candles myself, I am in no way an expert, *so I would advise against using this site as a primary reference for candle-related information*.
